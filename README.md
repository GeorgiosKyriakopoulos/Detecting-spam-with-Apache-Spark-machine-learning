This notebook presents pySpark code that processes and clasifies text data from a 
corpus of emails. The code implements data wrangling and classification techniques 
(i.e. logistic regression analysis) to build a process that recognises whether a certain 
email is spam or not. Alternative specifications of the classification technique used are 
explored to assess the performance and efficiency of the process.
